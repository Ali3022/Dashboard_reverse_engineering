**Part 2: Functional Element Analysis**

1. **KPI Boxes**:
   - Fields required for KPI boxes include Sessions (Integer), Page Views (Integer), Users (String), and Website Visits (Integer).
   - These metrics could change over time, so a Date field is also needed. Comparisons could be made by calculating the percentage change over a selected period.

2. **Graphs and Charts**:
   - To render the charts, Date, Sessions, Bounce Rate (Percentage), and Traffic Sources (String) fields are needed.
   - The X-axis typically represents the Date, while the Y-axis represents the metric (Sessions, Bounce Rate). Legends correspond to Traffic Sources.

3. **Filters and Controls**:
   - Filters need Date, Services (String), and Posts (String) fields.
   - The filters interact with the data in real-time, updating the charts and KPIs based on the selected values.
